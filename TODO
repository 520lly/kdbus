Message buffering/passing:
  - PAYLOAD_VEC: pass along mmap() of process data, instead of copying it
  - enforce page alignment of mmap()ed memory in the API, or do leader
    trailer pages?

External API:
  - check that enum values of 0 make sense, otherwise insert "*_NONE,"
  - always zero-out, put \0 in the padding bytes?
  - move alignment and iteration macros to kdbus.h?
  - allow to specify an address hint for where mmap()s should be placed
  - PAYLOAD_VEC needs to be cleaned up with KDBUS_CMD_MSG_PAYLOAD_UNREF

Kernel Core:
  - remove our own task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy() as soon as it's available:
      http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/tj/cgroup.git/commit/?h=review-task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy
  - use subsys_virtual_register() to avoid devices showing up directly
    in the root of /sys/devices/
      https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/tj/wq.git/commit/?h=for-3.10-subsys_virtual_register
