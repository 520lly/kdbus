External API:
  - place all arbitrary long return buffers in the pool instead
    of requiring the caller to supply a buffer of that size?
  - rules for: which unknown items to ignore in userspace?

Internal:
  - update/rethink kdbus_conn_accounting_sub_size() use, we don't allocate
    kernel memory anymore
  - memfd's file pos is shared, which can be confusing, document pread/pwrite
  - conn->ep->bus ==> conn->bus
