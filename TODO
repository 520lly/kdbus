External API:
  - _IOWR() vs. _IOR()/_IOW()?
  - struct kdbus_item cannot be included in structs, the unions are too
    large --> kind of annoying that things cannot be statically initialized

Internal:
  - chunk get_user_pages(), replace vmap() for writing to the slice in
    the receiver's pool
  - update/rethink kdbus_conn_accounting_sub_size() use, we don't allocate
    kernel memory anymore
  - BUG: connections are currently listed in the endpoint not the bus, so
    broadcasting will never see the other endpoints on the same bus
  - BUG: the sender needs to ref the receiver when looking it up to protect
    against the receiver going away while its ressources are accessed
  - BUG: kdbus_name_fill_info_items() needs to align the next record,
    convert to items?
  - shmem accounting when passing memfds: the creator of the file content
    accounts against its budget, security_vm_enough_memory_mm())?
  - how to limit memfd memory?
  - memfd's file pos is shared, which can be confusing, document pread/pwrite

Kernel Core:
  - remove our own task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy() as soon as it's available:
      http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/tj/cgroup.git/commit/?h=review-task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy
  - use subsys_virtual_register() when exported to modules
