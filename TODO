External API:
  - _IOWR() vs. _IOR()/_IOW()?
  - rules for: which unknown items to ignore in userspace?

Internal:
  - update/rethink kdbus_conn_accounting_sub_size() use, we don't allocate
    kernel memory anymore
  - memfd's file pos is shared, which can be confusing, document pread/pwrite
  - prefix all functions with kdbus_
  - conn->ep->bus ==> conn->bus

Kernel Core:
  - remove our own task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy() as soon as it's available:
      http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/tj/cgroup.git/commit/?h=review-task_cgroup_path_from_hierarchy
