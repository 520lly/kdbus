since RFC v1:

  * Make functions that create new objects return the newly allocated
    memory directly, rather than in a referenced function arguments.
    That implies using ERR_PTR() logic in many areas. Requested by
    Al Viro.

  * Use #defines rather than an enum for the ioctl signatures, so when
    new ones are added, usespace can use #ifdeffery to determine the
    function set at compile time. Suggested by Arnd Bergmann.

  * Rework pointer assignment logic and some other trivial fixes in
    handle.c. Reported by Thomas Gleixner.

  * Rename two details in kdbus.h to not overload the term 'name' too
    much:

     KDBUS_ITEM_CONN_NAME	→ KDBUS_ITEM_CONN_DESCRIPTION
     KDBUS_ATTACH_CONN_NAME	→ KDBUS_ATTACH_CONN_DESCRIPTION

  * Documentation fixes, by Peter Meerwald and others.

  * Per-user message count quota logic fixed, and new test added.
    By John de la Garza.

  * More test code for CONN_INFO ioctl
