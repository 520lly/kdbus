    <title>Matches for broadcast messages from other connections</title>
    <para>
      A message addressed at the connection ID
      <constant>KDBUS_DST_ID_BROADCAST</constant> (~0ULL) is a broadcast
      message, delivered to all connected peers which installed a rule to
      match certain properties of the message. Without any rules installed in
      the connection, no broadcast message or kernel-side notifications will be
      delivered to the connection. Broadcast messages are subject to policy
      rules and TALK access checks - see
      <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>kdbus.policy</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>7</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>
      for more details on implicit policies.
    </para>
    <para>
      Matches for messages from other connections (not kernel notifications) are
      implemented as bloom filters. The sender adds certain properties of the
      message as elements to a bloom filter bit field, and sends that along with
      the broadcast message.

      The connection adds the message properties it is interested as elements to
      a bloom mask bit field, and uploads the mask to the match rules of the
      connection.

      The kernel will match the broadcast message's bloom filter against the
      connections bloom mask (simply by &amp;-ing it), and decide whether the
      message should be delivered to the connection.
    </para>
    <para>
      The kernel has no notion of any specific properties of the message, all it
      sees are the bit fields of the bloom filter and mask to match against. The
      use of bloom filters allows simple and efficient matching, without
      exposing any message properties or internals to the kernel side. Clients
      need to deal with the fact that they might receive broadcasts which they
      did not subscribe to, as the bloom filter might allow false-positives to
      pass the filter.

      To allow the future extension of the set of elements in the bloom filter,
      the filter specifies a "generation" number. A later generation must always
      contain all elements of the set of the previous generation, but can add
      new elements to the set. The match rules mask can carry an array with all
      previous generations of masks individually stored. When the filter and
      mask are matched by the kernel, the mask with the closest matching
      "generation" is selected as the index into the mask array.
    </para>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Matches for kernel notifications</title>
    <para>
      To receive kernel generated notifications (see
      <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>kdbus.message</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>7</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>
      ), a connection must install special match rules that are different from
      the bloom filter matches described in the section above. They can be
      filtered by a sender connection's ID, by one of the name the sender
      connection owns at the time of sending the message, or by the type of
      the notification (ID/name add/remove/change).
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Matches for kernel notifications</title>
    <para>
      To add a match, the <constant>KDBUS_CMD_MATCH_ADD</constant> ioctl is
      used, which takes a struct of the struct described below.

      Note that each of the items attached to this command will internally
      create one match <emphasis>rule</emphasis>, and the collection of them,
      which is submitted as one block via the ioctl, is called a
      <emphasis>match</emphasis>. To allow a message to pass, all rules of a
      match have to be satisfied. Hence, adding more items to the command will
      only narrow the possibility of a match to effectively let the message
      pass, and will decrease the chance that the connection's userspace process
      wil be woken up.

      Multiple matches can be installed per connection. As long as one of it has
      a set of rules which allows the message to pass, this one will be
      decisive.

    <title>Bloom filters</title>
    <para>
      Bloom filters allow checking whether a given word is present in a dictionary.
      This allows connections to set up a mask for information it is interested in,
      and will be delivered signal messages that have a matching filter.

      For general information, see
      <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">the Wikipedia article on bloom filters</ulink>
    </para>
    <para>
      The size of the bloom filter is defined per bus when it is created, in
      <varname>kdbus_bloom_parameter.size</varname>. All bloom filters attached
      to signal messages on the bus must match this size, and all bloom filter
      matches uploaded by connections must also match the size, or a multiple
      thereof (see below).

      The calculation of the mask has to be done on the userspace side. The
      kernel just checks the bitmasks to decide whether or not to let the
      message pass. All bits in the mask must match the filter in and bit-wise
      <emphasis>AND</emphasis> logic, but the mask may have more bits set than
      the filter. Consequently, false positive matches are expected to happen,
      and userspace must deal with that fact by checking the contents of the
      payload again at receive time.
    </para>
    <para>
      Masks are entities that are always passed to the kernel as part of a
      match (with an item of type <constant>KDBUS_ITEM_BLOOM_MASK</constant>),
      and filters can be attached to signals, with an item of type
      <constant>KDBUS_ITEM_BLOOM_FILTER</constant>. For a filter to match, all
      its bits have to be set in the match mask as well.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, consider a bus that has a bloom size of 8 bytes, and the following
      mask/filter combinations:
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
          filter  0x0101010101010101
          mask    0x0101010101010101
                  -> matches

          filter  0x0303030303030303
          mask    0x0101010101010101
                  -> doesn't match

          filter  0x0101010101010101
          mask    0x0303030303030303
                  -> matches
    ]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      Hence, in order to catch all messages, a mask filled with
      <constant>0xff</constant> bytes can be installed as a wildcard match rule.
    </para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Generations</title>

      <para>
        Uploaded matches may contain multiple masks, which have are as large as
        the bloom size defined by the bus. Each block of a mask is called a
        <emphasis>generation</emphasis>, starting at index 0.

        At match time, when a signal is about to be delivered, a bloom mask
        generation is passed, which denotes which of the bloom masks the filter
        should be matched against. This allows userspace to provide backward
        compatible masks at upload time, while older clients can still match
        against older versions of filters.
