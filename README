Nothing to see here, move along.

Seriously, don't look at this yet, it's horrible, wrong, and will change
before it is submitted for inclusion into the Linux kernel.

If you wish to talk to me about this code base, please reconsider, I
currently have 8 pages of scribbled notes on what needs to be done, any
distractions at this point in time is pretty pointless.

And yes, the code is LGPLv2+, that is on purpose for now.
